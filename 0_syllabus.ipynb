    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "Welcome to your first course in numerical methods (maybe).  Numerical methods and computational science and engineering have often been said to comprise the \"third\" pillar of science if that gives you a scope for its applicability, so that's exciting.  We will cover a wide variety of topics to give you at least a taste as to the wide variety of uses these methods can have, exploring a large variety of these applications while studying each of the different topics.

    "1. **Select** an appropriate method for a given problem,\n",

    " - This course will be partially \"flipped\", i.e. you will be expected to watch course lectures outside of class time and class time instead will be devoted to working on guided group work and programming as this is the \"real\" way to learn the material.  This is a bit of an experiment but wider experience has suggested this is the most effective way to learn this material."

    " - Peer-review of homework will be part of your grade.  This will be randomly assigned and will based on simple completion of the review which will be handed back to the writer of the code.  This will hopefully enable you to get a broader idea of how others approached the problem, improve your ability to read others code (a key component to any job where you might be working on numerical related problems), and hopefully improve your success at writing readable, maintainable, and clear code."
